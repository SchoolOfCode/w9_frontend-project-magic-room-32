## Getting Started
How can we enhance the remote experience of a bootcamper? This was the problem at hand, the solution that we decided to come up with was a progress tracking app. That allows the user to track their progress through each week and see how they are getting on and in future to display various resources linked with areas they have struggled with. 

SMALL CODE EXAMPLE

(Include small code snippets with brief explanations)

Our app allows the user to input their daily quiz result for each week and calculates the average score in percentage. This enables the user to have a better understanding of their progress and to see whether extra studying is needed. In addition to this, there is a diary section which allows the user to submit their thoughts and feelings for that particular week.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 

** [Front-End] (https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_frontend-project-magic-room-32) **

- `cd front/`
- Run `npm i`
- `npm start`

** [Back-End] (https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_backend-project-magic-room-32) **

- Run `npm i`.
- Create a .env file at the top-level.
- Configure the file using the following Postgresql variables and your server’s relevant settings:
```
PGHOST 
PGUSER 
PGDATABASE 
PGPASSWORD
PGPORT 
PORT
```
- Ensure that the ‘PORT’ is set to something other than the front-end. By default, the front-end is configured to use 3000. We would suggest setting the back-end to listen on 3001.
- Use the following command for first-time setup: `npm run setUpTables`.
- Run `npm start`.

Once you have both of these up and running you may go to your browser and go to “localhost:3000” to view our application.
